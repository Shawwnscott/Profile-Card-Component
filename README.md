## My process

### What I learned

Whit this challenge i learnt how to use multiple backgrounds and how to position them. Though a foreign concept to me, i was able to figure it out on myself and i'm proud of that.


### Continued development

I aim to continue getting familiar and comfortable with using paddings and margins as i am still having difficulties with them.
